# Summary
summary: This app allows you to upload your own macroinvertebrate data (from the Melbourne region) to calculate LUMaR score, a new indicator of stream condition, developed by Walsh and Webb (2013), that provides improved, consistent assessment of urban and forest-loss impacts across the Melbourne region. It is linked to an unofficial R package, melbstreambiota, which allows LUMaR calculation in R.
